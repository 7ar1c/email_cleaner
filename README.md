A little thing I cooked up to help clean up spam in your inbox (I didn't want to pay for an existing service). You must OAuth before using it. The first button lists the unique unsubscrible links from your 1000 most recent emails that contain "unsubscribe" in the body. Unfortunately, you do still have to go through each link yourself to unsubscribe. The second button takes the most recent 10,000 emails, sorts them into a label called "junkyjunk" and removes them from your inbox. This is super slow because the API rate limit is 5/sec. You can run this on your localhost, I promise I'm not trying to steal any information. However, if you decide to use this and something goes wrong, this is your official warning that I'm not a software engineer. Enjoy!
